Prior to Neo4j 3.0, if you wanted to parse the JSON results from a call to a Web API, it would require you use one of the 
database drivers to fetch and parse the JSON data. This is described https://neo4j.com/blog/cypher-load-json-from-url/[here].

With the inclusion of stored procedures as part of Neo4j 3.0.x and the https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures[APOC] procedure package, one can read the JSON data and create nodes and relationships in the graph.  The following describes how this is accomplished when using the https://developers.trello.com/[Trello API]. Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello shows you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. The Trello
https://trello.com/guide/board_basics.html[taxonomy] includes boards, lists, and cards where tasks are recorded.

When using the Trello API you must register an API key and token as they are required to access the URL. The key and token can be created  https://trello.com/app-key[here]. In the example below, the generated key and token are:   

[source,conf]
----
key=00981709d8fa49b9fb3c66f41178c14h
token=06128ee9bb10787d6fdee4942c12b5de5f39be11794fcb0604e072e1940475e2
----

And the goal of the Cypher in this example is to create a Graph Model similar to:

To produce such a data model we are going to interact with the Trello API https://developers.trello.com/advanced-reference/member#get-1-members-idmember-or-username-actions[/1/member/me/actions?filter=createCard] which will return a
JSON result representing the detail on when cards were created. Additionally, the inclusion of the 'me' value in the URL indicates
to only retrieve createCards actions that I have taken.

[source,json]
----
   {
        "id": "56f29d59ef82d7312c56710f",
        "idMemberCreator": "5637836872deaba954947610",
        "data": {
            "board": {
                "name": "New Features Board",
                "id": "563ce96c73ae60bc1a3d40"
                "shortLink": "bYO0FVJ7Q",
            },
            "list": {
                "name": "Inbox",
                "id": "55f7f0db68294b2a319c0519"
            }card": {
                "shortLink": "OwUvlhf7",
                "idShort": 464,
                "name": "request for support of Java8",
                "id": "734"
            }
        },
        "type": "createCard",
        "date": "2014-01-15T13:42:49.055Z",
        "memberCreator": {
            "id": "123",
            "avatarHash": "1f5a1bc9710166186f6fdd8c8b806c58",
            "fullName": "Dana Canzano",
            "initials": "DC",
            "username": "danacanzano"
        }
    },

The following Cypher will process the JSON results of the `/1/member/me/actions` request:

[source,cypher]
----
WITH "https://api.trello.com/1/member/me/actions?filter=createCard&limit=1000&key=00981709d8fa49b9fb3c66f41178c14h&token=06128ee9bb10787d6fdee4942c12b5de5f39be11794fcb0604e072e1940475e2" AS url
CALL apoc.load.json(url) YIELD value AS action
WITH action, action.memberCreator AS m, action.data AS d
MERGE (u:User {id:m.id}) ON CREATE SET u.initials = m.initials, u.name = m.fullname, u.user = m.username
MERGE (b:Board {id: d.board.id}) ON CREATE SET b = d.board
MERGE (c:Card {id: d.card.id}) ON CREATE SET c = d.card
MERGE (u)-[r:CREATED]->(c) ON CREATE SET r.id = action.id, r.date_created=apoc.date.parse(action.date,'s',"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'")
MERGE (c)-[:IN_BOARD]->(b)
RETURN count(*);
----

And then one can run 

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User)-[r:CREATED]->(c:Card)-[r2:IN_BOARD]->(b:Board) 
RETURN u.user AS Author, r.date_created,c.name AS CardName ,b.name AS BoardName
----

This is helpful in attempting to find metrics about the author/creator of Trello cards.

The above is but one example of the Trello API and all data represented above is not actual data but representations.
