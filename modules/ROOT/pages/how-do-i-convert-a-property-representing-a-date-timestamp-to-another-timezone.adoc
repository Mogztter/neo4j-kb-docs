https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/3.5/syntax/temporal/[Temporal datatype] support was introduced with with Neo4j 3.4 and as a result it 
is possible to record a date timestamp with timezone as a property value.

The following Cypher can be used to convert a date timestamp with timezone from one timezone to another

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Person) 
       where    exists(n.date_enrolled)
       return   n.date_enrolled,
                datetime({datetime:datetime(n.date_enrolled), timezone:'America/New York'}) as EST limit 1;
----

For example using the following data

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n:Person) set n.date_enrolled='2019-02-26T01:23:40Z'
----

in this case the property date_enrolled is recorded as a string and represents 2019-02-26 at time 01:23:40 UTC

and the above `MATCH` statement will return

----
n.date_enrolled       | EST
"2019-02-26T01:23:40Z"â”‚"2019-02-25T20:23:40[America/New_York]"
