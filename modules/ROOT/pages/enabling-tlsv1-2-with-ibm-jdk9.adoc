Neo4j 3.4.0 only supports TLSv1.2 by default. IBM JDK9 uses the TLSv1 protocol by default. When attempting to run cypher-shell, users will be unable to connect to Neo4j.

To enable TLSv1.2 in the IBM JDK, set the following `JAVA OPT`:

[source,shell]
----
export JAVA_OPTS='-Dcom.ibm.jsse2.overrideDefaultTLS=true'
----

If you want the `JAVA_OPT` to be set for every shell you start afterwards, add that line to `~/.profile` as well.
