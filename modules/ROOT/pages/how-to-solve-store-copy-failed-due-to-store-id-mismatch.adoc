It is possible that after seeding a cluster or restoring from a backup, you may encounter the following error while starting your cluster:

`ERROR [o.n.c.c.s.s.CoreStateDownloader] Store copy failed due to store ID mismatch`

In most of the cases, this issue can be resolved by taking the following steps:

[source,shell]
----
- $neo4j-home> bin/neo4j stop
- $neo4j-home> bin/neo4j-admin unbind
- $neo4j-home> bin/neo4j start
----

In the situation where the member of the cluster is unresponsive, then you will have to add two more steps:

[source,shell]
----
- $neo4j-home> bin/neo4j stop
- $neo4j-home> bin/neo4j-admin unbind
- remove the graph.db 
- restore graph.db from another core server
- $neo4j-home> bin/neo4j start
----

If after taking the above steps, your cluster does not come up, then please open a ticket with Neo4j Customer Support.
