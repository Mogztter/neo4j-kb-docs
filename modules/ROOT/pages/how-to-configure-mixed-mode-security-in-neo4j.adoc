For environments where you need both LDAP authentication as well as some native user accounts, there is a way to allow this in Neo4j 3.1 and newer. Use the configuration setting `dbms.security.auth_providers` instead of the singular version `dbms.security.auth_provider`. This will allow you to supply a list of providers to use for authentication. 

To allow both LDAP and native users to login, use the following setting in `conf/neo4j.conf`:

[source,conf]
----
dbms.security.auth_providers=ldap,native
----

To control at a finer level which auth provider does (authentication and/or authorization), use the following settings as well (in the example we are setting all to `true`, but this can differ based on specific needs):

[source,conf]
----
dbms.security.native.authentication_enabled=true
dbms.security.native.authorization_enabled=true
dbms.security.ldap.authentication_enabled=true
dbms.security.ldap.authorization_enabled=true
----
