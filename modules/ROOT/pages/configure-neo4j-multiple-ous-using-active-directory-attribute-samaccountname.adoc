Beginning with Neo4j version https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/wiki/Neo4j-3.2-changelog#322[3.2.2], it is possible to authenticate using
the Active Directory attribute **samAccountName** as opposed to the LDAP Display Name attribute. This is described in detail in the following 
KB article: link:https://support.neo4j.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013527168[How do I allow for authentication using Active Directory attribute samAccountName]

However, when you need to authenticate and authorize users who are defined under different OUs, and cannot define a System Account in the Neo4j configuration file, a slightly different configuration is needed. This is specific to Active Directory, and requires logging in with the samAccountName attribute (which we have found to be the common case).

The following `conf/neo4j.conf` parameters must be set to use **samAccountName** and support authenticating users from multiple OUs:

[source,conf]
----
dbms.security.auth_enabled=true
dbms.security.auth_provider=ldap
dbms.security.ldap.host=<the LDAP hostname>

dbms.security.ldap.authentication.user_dn_template={0}@example.com
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_base=dc=example,dc=com 
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.user_search_filter=(&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName={0})) 

dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_membership_attributes=memberOf
dbms.security.ldap.authorization.group_to_role_mapping=\
"cn=Neo4j Read Only,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com" = reader ;\
"cn=Neo4j Read-Write,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com" = publisher ;\
"cn=Neo4j Schema Manager,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com" = architect ;\
"cn=Neo4j Administrator,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com" = admin ;\
"cn=Neo4j Procedures,cn=Users,dc=example,dc=com" = allowed_role
----

== Key points:

. The main difference that allows this to work is specifying the `+{0}@example.com+` pattern in the `user_dn_template`. This allows the authentication to start at the root Domain, and check the whole tree, regardless of where the User is located within it.
. Notice you should NOT set `dbms.security.ldap.authentication.use_samaccountname`. It will not work properly.

With the following AD setup we successfully authenicate both users Admin User and Support User. They would login with `adminuser` and `supportuser1` respectively:
