If your data model has choosen to define multiple labels on a node, for example

[source,cypher]
----
create (n:Actor:Director {name:'Clint Eastwood'})
----
 
To find all nodes which are defined with both labels of `Actor` AND `Director` use the following Cypher:

[source,cypher]
----
match (n) where n:Actor and n:Director return n;
----
 
Using this syntax will be performant as it will start with a `NodeByLabelScan`
 
If you need to find all nodes which have either label of `Actor` OR `Director` use the following Cypher:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Actor) RETURN n UNION MATCH (n:Director) RETURN n
----
 
Using this syntax will be performant as it will perform a `NodeByLabelScan` on both the `Actor` label and the `Director` label and then merge the results.
