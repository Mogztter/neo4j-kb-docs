From Neo4j 3.0 access to `neo4j-shell` is no longer possible from the desktop-installers for Windows and OSX.

To use `neo4j-shell`, you have to download the TAR/ZIP distribution from: http://neo4j.com/download/other-releases/

For importing files that contain semicolon separated cypher commands, you can also use:

* http://www.lyonwj.com/LazyWebCypher/[LazyWebCypher, a web based tool]
* https://github.com/nicolewhite/cycli[CyCli-Shell (Python)] (`pip install cycli`)
* https://cleishm.github.io/libneo4j-client/[libneo4j-client (Ansi-C)]


The http://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j[official Neo4j-Docker image] can also come handy.
