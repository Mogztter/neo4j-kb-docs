Although assigning a node one or moreÂ labels provides many benefits (i.e. performance gains from index usage, ability to group nodes into sets, etc), it is possible to create a node without any labels.

The following Cypher can be used to identify all nodes in the graph which have no label defined:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n) WHERE size(labels(n)) = 0 RETURN n
----

Label usage is detailed https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/graphdb-concepts/#graphdb-labels[here].
