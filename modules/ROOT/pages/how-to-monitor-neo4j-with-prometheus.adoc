Commencing with the release of Neo4j Enterprise 3.4, one can now use the open source monitoring tool 
https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] to monitor Neo4j.
The following article details a basic Prometheus implementation to demonstrate the connectivity between Prometheus v2.2.1 and Neo4j.

After installing Prometheus, Neo4j needs to be configured via its `neo4j.conf` file with the following parameters:

[source,conf]
----
# Enable the Prometheus endpoint. Default is 'false'.
metrics.prometheus.enabled=true
# The IP and port the endpoint will bind to in the format <hostname or IP address>:<port number>.
# The default is localhost:2004.
metrics.prometheus.endpoint=localhost:2004
----

and the `prometheus.yml` file should be configured as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'Neo4j-prometheus'

    # metrics_path: /metrics
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:2004']
----

In the above configuration snippets, Prometheus has been installed on the same server as Neo4j.  If you choose to install it on a different server, simply replace references to localhost above with the IP address of the Neo4j instance.

Launching the Prometheus browser at **http://<IP of Prometheus Server>:9090** and clicking the menu option `Status` -> `Targets` should display:

Returning back to the 3rd menu choice of `Graphs` one can define a graph to monitor a Neo4j metric. For example, in the detail below the
graph represents the number of transactions started (neo4j_transaction_started):
