In most Neo4j server environments, all logs will be found in *NEO4J_HOME/logs*. However, when Neo4j is running as a service on a Ubuntu (debian) 
Linux environment, usually installed via `apt-get install neo4j` or similar, the neo4j.log is not present.

To get the contents of this, since neo4j.log just contains STDOUT content, simply look for the neo4j service log contents using `journalctl`:

[source,shell]
----
neo4j@ubuntu:/var/log/neo4j$ journalctl -u neo4j -b > neo4j.log
neo4j@ubuntu:/var/log/neo4j$ vi neo4j.log
----

For a complete reference of where logs and other files are located in various environments, please refer to the official documentation:
