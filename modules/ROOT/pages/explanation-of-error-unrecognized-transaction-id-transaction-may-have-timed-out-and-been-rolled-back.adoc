When submitting a request via the http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/rest-api-transactional.html[Neo4j Transactional Cypher HTTP endpoint], one may encounter the following error

----
Unrecognized transaction id.
Transaction may have timed out and been rolled back
----

This error may occur as a result of the transactions expiration date/time being met.
By default, http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/server-configuration.html#_important_server_configuration_parameters[org.neo4j.server.transaction.timeout] describes the number of seconds whereby inactivity in a transaction will result in the transaction automatically rolling back.
The default is 60 seconds but can be overridden by adding

[source,conf]
----
org.neo4j.server.transaction.timeout=XXX
----

where XXX represents number of seconds, to the conf/neo4j-server.properties and then restarting neo4j via `bin/neo4j restart`.

Alternatively one can either, keep the transaction open by periodically performing a keep-alive via the REST API and as described via http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/rest-api-transactional.html#rest-api-reset-transaction-timeout-of-an-open-transaction[Â /db/data/transaction/XXX], or committing the transaction sooner by http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/rest-api-transactional.html#rest-api-commit-an-open-transaction[/db/data/transaction/XXX/commit] where XXX represents the transaction number

Note `bin/neo4j-shell` does not utilize the REST API and as such the `org.neo4j.server.transaction.timeout` has no effect on transactions created within a begin commit within `neo4j-shell`.
