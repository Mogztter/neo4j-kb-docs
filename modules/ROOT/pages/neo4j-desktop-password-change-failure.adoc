Error message on a clean install of Desktop 1.0.2x, Neo4j DB version 3.3.x, error says:
"Database failed to create: Error: Could not change password neo4j"

== Fix:

Cause is a lack of permissions on the auth files at $NEO4J_HOME/data/dbms/ usually encountered upon an upgrade or a re-install without completely removing previous installation directories. Emptying %NEO4J_HOME%/data/dbms, followed by Neo4j-Desktop restart should fix it.
