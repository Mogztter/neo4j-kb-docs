When you try to import data from a file using LOAD CSV where the filename containing spaces for example you get the following error:

Statement:

[source,cypher]
----
load csv from "file:///test copy.csv" as row return row
----

Error:

----
java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in path at index 10: file:/test copy.csv
----

To allow for a space in the filename, simply replace the space in the LOAD CSV command with *%20* (url encoding)

[source,cypher]
----
load csv from "file:///test%20copy.csv" as row return row
----

Similarly, if you have any other characters (such as *\#*) in the filename, simply replace that charater with the appropriate ASCII url encoding (for *#* it happens to be *%23*).
