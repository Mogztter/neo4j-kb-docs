When running `$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j-backup` if a Java out of heap/memory error occurs you may want define the init and max 
Java heap to be used by `neo4j-backup`. The default behavior is to allow the JVM to define the init and max heap as as described 
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/parallel.html#default_heap_size[here].

To define the init and max heap, before running `$NEO4J_HOME/bin/neo4j-backup` define the environment varaible `JAVA_OPTS`, for example:

[source,shell]
----
export JAVA_OPTS='-Xms2048m -Xmx2048m'
----

which will set the init and max Java heap to 2GB.
