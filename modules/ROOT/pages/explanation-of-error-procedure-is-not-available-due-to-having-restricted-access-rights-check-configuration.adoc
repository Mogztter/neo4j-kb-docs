Commencing with Neo4j 3.2 when running a stored procedure, for example

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.warmup.run();
----

this may error with

[source,shell]
----
apoc.warmup.run is not available due to having restricted access rights, check configuration.
----

The cause of this error is as a result of not configuring the https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/security/securing-extensions/[security extensions].
To allow for all https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures[APOC] procedures to be available to all users define the conf/neo4j.conf as

[source,conf]
----
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=apoc.*
----

If you have installed Neo4j as a Docker container then to achieve the same you would initiate Neo4j by running

[source,shell]
----
docker run \
    -e NEO4J_dbms_security_procedures_unrestricted=apoc.\\\* \
    -v $PWD/plugins:/plugins \
    --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
    --volume=$HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs \
