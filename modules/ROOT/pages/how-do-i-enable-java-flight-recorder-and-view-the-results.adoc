http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html[Java Flight Recorder] can 
be used to capture low level Java properties and run-time data about Java processes, for example Neo4j.

Per https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/tooldescr002.html

----
The Java Flight Recorder (JFR) is a commercial feature. You can use it for free on developer desktops/laptops, and for
evaluation purposes in test, development, and production environments. However, to enable JFR on a production server,
you require a commercial license. Using JMC UI for other purposes on the JDK does not require a commercial license.
----

To enable the Java Flight Recorder the following JVM options should be added to the `neo4j.conf`

For 3.x

[source,conf]
----
dbms.jvm.additional=-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures
dbms.jvm.additional=-XX:+FlightRecorder
dbms.jvm.additional=-XX:FlightRecorderOptions=defaultrecording=true,settings=profile
----

and then Neo4j needs to be restarted for these changes to take effect.

To begin a time based recording, at the command line run:

`$JAVA_HOME/jcmd <pid> JFR.start duration=3600s filename=myrecording.jfr settings=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/jfr/profile.jfc `

replacing <pid> with the linux pid for the Neo4j process (i.e.  `ps -eaf | grep java`).  

The inclusion of `duration=3600s`, should have resulted in a recording that spanned 1 hour and this file will be written to at the completion of the 1 hour run.

The reference to `filename=myrecording.jfr` above, describes the output file to be produced.
When no path is defined the resultant file will be recorded at `$NEO4J_HOME`.  Alternatively one could define filename with a full path reference, for example filename=/tmp/myrecording.jfr

Also the location of the profile.jfc may be at a different directory/path for your given install.   
The expected path is in $JRE_HOME/lib/jfr 

If you do not know how long to run the recording since the issue may be intermittent, run

[source,shell]
----
$JAVA_HOME/jcmd <pid> JFR.start settings=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/jfr/profile.jfc
----

and to which this will report 

----
3962:
Started recording 1. No limit (duration/maxsize/maxage) in use.

Use JFR.dump recording=1 filename=FILEPATH to copy recording data to file.
----

and to then dump the recording to a file run

[source,shell]
----
jcmd <pid> JFR.dump recording=<recording #> filename=<filename>
----

and then to completely stop the recording, though this does not dump the contents of the recording to a file run

[source,shell]
----
jcmd <pid> JFR.stop recording=<recording #>
----

To view the results start Java Mission Control (`$JAVA/HOME/jmc`).
This will launch a Java app as detailed below.
Note, if you are connected via http://www.putty.org/[Putty] or a Telnet client this may not launch.
As an alternative, http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/[MobaXterm] can be used.

The resultant Java Flight Recorder file can be analyzed using http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/mission-control/java-mission-control-1998576.html[Java Mission Control].
To start Java Mission Control run $JAVA_HOME/jmc.
Once started, using menu File / Open File, one can then browse to the flight recorder file.
