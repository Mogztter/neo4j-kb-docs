As tested and verified with Neo4j 2.3.0, the `data/graph.db/messages.log`, its size and number of rotated archives is governed by the following parameters in the `conf/neo4j.properties` file

|*Name* |*Description* |*Default*

|http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/configuration-settings.html#config_store.internal_log.max_archives[store.internal_log.max_archives]
|Maximum number of history files for the internal log. |7

|http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/configuration-settings.html#config_store.internal_log.rotation_threshold[store.internal_log.rotation_threshold]
|Threshold for rotation of the internal log. |20MBÂ

// what's up with the ellipses?
With the above default parameters one should expect to see no `data/graph.db/messages.log` exceed 20MB and we will keep up to 7 archives, namely `data/graph.db/messages.log.1`, `data/graph.db/messages.log.2` ... `data/graph.db/messages.log.7`.

If you wish to change the defaults the `conf/neo4j.properties` file would need to include the new values for

[source,conf]
----
store.internal_log.max_archives=<N number of archives>
----
// what's up with this line below? Why is the line above in a block and this one not?
store.internal_log.rotation_threshold=< # of bytes before the file is
rotated>

and then issue a `bin/neo4j restart` for the new parameters to take effect.

Prior to 2.3.0 one would need to use the linux built in functionality of `logrotate`
