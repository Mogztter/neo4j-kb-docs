Commencing with Neo4j 3.0, the default location for your `graph.db` directory is under `$NEO4J_HOME\databases\`.
To change the path for the location of the database directory, edit the following parameters in the `$NEO4J_HOME\conf\neo4j.conf` file

[source,conf]
----
# The name of the database to mount
dbms.active_database=graph.db

# Paths of directories in the installation.
dbms.directories.data=C:/MyNeoDB/
----

The usage of the forward slash character (/) in the value for `dbms.directories.data` is to be used and not the backslash (\) character which is what is typically used in Windows path names. +

Using the above example the `graph.db` will be recorded in `C:\MyNeoDB\databases` and the directory will be named `graph.db`.
