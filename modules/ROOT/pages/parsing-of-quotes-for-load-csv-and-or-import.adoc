When using http://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/clauses/load-csv/[LOAD CSV] or
https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/tools/import/[neo4j-admin import] if your data contains quotes they must be properly
escaped to be imported otherwise one might encounter the error

*neo4j-admin import error*

Error in input data
Caused by:ERROR in input
  data source: BufferedCharSeeker[source:/home/neo4j/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0/bin/hr.csv, position:59, line:2]
  in field: name:string:2
  for header: [id:int, name:string, supervisor:int]
  raw field value: 2
  original error: At /home/neo4j/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0/bin/hr.csv:2 -  there's a field starting with a quote and whereas it ends that quote there seems to be characters in that field after that ending quote. That isn't supported. This is what I read: 'Bill"'

*LOAD CSV error*
[source,cypher]

LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///hr.csv" AS row FIELDTERMINATOR ','  CREATE (n:Staff { staffid: toInt(row.id), staff_name: row.name});
At /home/neo4j/neo4j-enterprise-3.3.0/import/hr.csv:2 -  there's a field starting with a quote and whereas it ends that quote there seems to be characters in that field after that ending quote. That isn't supported. This is what I read: 'Bill"'
----

For the above case my hr.csv is defined as 

[source,csv]
----
id:int,name:string,supervisor:int
1,Emil Eifrem,1
2,"Bill" William Smith,1
3,Dana Canzano,2
----

And the failure is with parsing line 2 and as a result of the line starting with a `"`.   In order to import the above into Neo4j and 
have line 2 be recognized as `"Bill" William Smith` the data needs to be reformatted to

[source,csv]
----
id:int,name:string,supervisor:int
1,Emil Eifrem,1
2,"""Bill"" William Smith",1
3,Dana Canzano,2
----

The data will then successfully import as evidence

[source,shell]
----
neo4j> match (n) return n;
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| n                                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| (:Staff {name: "Emil Eifrem", id: 1, supervisor: 1})            |
| (:Staff {name: "\"Bill\" William Smith", id: 2, supervisor: 1}) |
| (:Staff {name: "Dana Canzano", id: 3, supervisor: 2})           |
