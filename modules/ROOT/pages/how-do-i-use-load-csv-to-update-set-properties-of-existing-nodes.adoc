One can use `LOAD CSV` to perform a bulk update to existing nodes, and create new nodes, as follows.

If we have a .csv calledÂ `Movies.csv` and its content is:

[source,csv]
----
code,wysiwyg-indent3
code,wysiwyg-indent3
101,The Matrix,463420706
102,The Matrix Reloaded,738576929
103,The Matrix Revolutions,427289109
104,A Few Good Men,24234017
----

and the current graph includes nodes with a label `Movie` for the 1st three movies listed, then the following `LOAD CSV` Cypher statement will result in updating the TotalRevenue property for the three existing `Movie` nodes and creating a new node for the fourth movie, namely `A Few Good Men`:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV FROM "file:///Movies.csv" AS csvLine
MERGE (n:Movie {id:csvLine[0]})
ON CREATE SET n.id=csvLine[0],n.name=csvLine[1], n.TotalRevenue = csvLine[2]
ON MATCH SET n.TotalRevenue = csvLine[2]
----

Running the above Cypher the first time will result in:

----
Added 1 label, created 1 node, set 7 properties
----

Subsequent re-runs of the same `LOAD CSV` will result in:

----
Set 4 properties
----
