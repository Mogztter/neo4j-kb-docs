With a traditional SQL based database a HAVING clause will restrict aggregated values.  For example 

[source,sql]
----
select zipcode, count(*) as population 
from Person 
group by zipcode
having population>100000;
----

will return all zipcodes which have more than 100k residents.   
To achieve the same in Cypher use the following

[source,cypher]
----
match (n:Person) 
with n.zipcode as zip, count(*) as population 
where population>100000
return zip,population
----
