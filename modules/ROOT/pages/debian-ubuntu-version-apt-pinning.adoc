If you want to run a specific version of Neo4j and install the software via a https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/linux/debian/#debian[debian repository^] you need to use a technique called https://wiki.debian.org/AptPreferences[apt pinning^]. Otherwise any system update will also update Neo4j to its latest stable version.

As an example assume you want to make sure to stay on 3.3.x versions - effectivly preventing an upgrade to 3.4.x or higher. 
To use apt pinning create a file `/etc/apt.d/preferences.d/neo4j` with these contents

[source,shell]
