Commencing with Neo4j 2.3.x it is possible to create the equivalent of a primary key on a property of a label.
For example the following CypherÂ 

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (book:Book) ASSERT book.isbn IS UNIQUE
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (book:Book) ASSERT exists(book.isbn)
----

will create two constraints on the property `isbn` of nodes with label `Book` and ensure that when a new Book node is created, its `isbn` must be defined, and that it must be unique across all nodes with the `Book` label.


[NOTE]
====
Property existence constraints are only available in the Neo4j Enterprise Edition.
Databases with property existence constraints cannot be opened using Neo4j Community Edition.
