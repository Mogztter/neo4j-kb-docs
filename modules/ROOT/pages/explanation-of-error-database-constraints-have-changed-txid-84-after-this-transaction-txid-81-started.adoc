The following error, via `bin/neo4j-shell`:

[source,shell]
----
Database constraints have changed (txId=84) after this transaction (txId=81) started, which is not yet supported. Please retry your transaction to ensure all constraints are executed.

or as logged in `log/debug.log` (3.x) or `graph.db/messages.log` (2.3.x):

can be explained by the following scenario:   

[width="80%",options="header"]
|=======
|txID |Date/time | Cypher Statement
|81 | Oct-19-2012 09:00|     Begin
|84 | Oct-19-2012 09:01| Begin
|84 | Oct-19-2012 09:02|     create constraint on (n:Person) assert n.user_id is unique;
|84 | Oct-19-2012 09:03| Commit
|81 | Oct-19-2012 09:04|     create (n:Person {user_id:1234})
|81 | Oct-19-2012 09:05| Commit
|=======

where the exception is thrown at Oct-19-2012 09:05 by the Cypher statement with txID 81 when it tries to create a node which applies to the newly committed constraint, and the transaction is rolled back. Correct remedial action is to resubmit the failed transaction.
