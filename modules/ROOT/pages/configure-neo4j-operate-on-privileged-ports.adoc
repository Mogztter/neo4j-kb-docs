In some environments, users are required to run Neo4j on ports lower than 1024 due to corporate policies. The following is a sample configuration showing how to configure Neo4j 3.5 and newer to listen on those ports.

Refer to a  `path/to/file`.


1. Configure `neo4j.conf` to set the http, https and bolt ports.

On a debian installation it would look like this:

In the `/etc/neo4j/pre-neo4j.sh` file, configure this as follows:

[source,shell]
----
# HTTPS
echo "dbms_connector_https_enabled" "${dbms_connector_https_enabled:=true}"
echo "dbms_connector_https_listen_address" "${dbms_connector_https_listen_address:=0.0.0.0:80}"

# HTTP
echo "dbms_connector_http_enabled" "${dbms_connector_http_enabled:=false}"
echo "dbms_connector_http_listen_address" "${dbms_connector_http_listen_address:=0.0.0.0:7474}"

# BOLT
echo "dbms_connector_bolt_enabled" "${dbms_connector_bolt_enabled:=true}"
echo "dbms_connector_bolt_listen_address" "${dbms_connector_bolt_listen_address:=0.0.0.0:8080}"
echo "dbms_connector_bolt_tls_level" "${dbms_connector_bolt_tls_level:=REQUIRED}"
----

On a tar installation it would look like this:

[source,shell]
----
# Bolt connector
dbms.connector.bolt.enabled=true
#dbms.connector.bolt.tls_level=OPTIONAL
dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address=:8080

# HTTP Connector. There can be zero or one HTTP connectors.
dbms.connector.http.enabled=false
#dbms.connector.http.listen_address=:7474

# HTTPS Connector. There can be zero or one HTTPS connectors.
dbms.connector.https.enabled=true
dbms.connector.https.listen_address=:80

2. Identify the location of the java installation.
+
[source,shell]
----
readlink -f $(which java)
----

3. Bind the java executable to the privileged ports (use the path found in step 2).
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+eip /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java
----

4. Neo4j should start and allow access via https on port 80.
