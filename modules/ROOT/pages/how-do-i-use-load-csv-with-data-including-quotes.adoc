When using *LOAD CSV* to read a file which includes data with double quote characters ("), the quotes need to be escaped as 2 double quote characters

For example if your data file (courses.csv) included the following content

[source,csv]
----
COURSE_ID|COURSE_TITLE
1215,"""Graphs are EveryWhere"" : An Introduction to Neo4j"
----

and using the folloiwng LOAD CSV command

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///courses.csv" AS row CREATE (:Course { courseID: toInt(row.COURSE_ID), courseTitle: row.COURSE_TITLE});
----

the this would create a Course node with the following properties

courseID = 1215 +
courseTitle = "Graphs are Everywhere" : An Introduction to Neo4j
