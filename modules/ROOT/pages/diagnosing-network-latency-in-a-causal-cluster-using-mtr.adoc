MTR is a simple ICMP based test combining ping and traceroute. The following demonstrates usage of the MTR trace tool to 
diagnose network latency and packet loss in a Causal Cluster. The tool is commonly used on Windows via the WinMTR tool 
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/), however this article describes its example usage via the unix terminal. 
Installation and various usage options are beyond the scope of this article. A good reference for these can be found at 
the linode website referenced at the end of this article.

*OSX Installation*

[source,shell]
----
brew install mtr`
----

this should allow execution as `sudo /usr/local/sbin/mtr` however, executing the below two commands simplifies execution as 
`sudo mtr`:

[source,shell]
----
sudo ln /usr/local/Cellar/mtr/0.92/sbin/mtr /usr/local/bin/mtr
sudo ln /usr/local/Cellar/mtr/0.92/sbin/mtr-packet /usr/local/bin/mtr-packet
----

To install using MacPorts, run 

[source,shell]
----
port install mtr
----

*Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)*

[source,shell]
----
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install mtr-tiny
----

*CentOS/RHEL/Fedora*

[source,shell]
----
yum update
yum install mtr
----

Examples below describe usage on OSX only, but usage on other operating systems is very similar.

*Usage*

[source,shell]
----
sudo mtr <destination domain name or ip>
----

image::https://imgur.com/RcjPzMD.png[A simple MTR trace]

If a summary, rather than real-time response updates, is desired, execute:

`sudo mtr -rwn -i 2 -c 5 <domain name or ip> > /User/<username>/Desktop/mtr.txt` where `i` is the ping interval 
in seconds and in this case is 2. This outputs the trace report to an mtr.txt file at the above specified location.

Run `mtr -P <tcp port> -T -w  <destination ip>` to generate a report. By default it sends 10 packets to the host. 
The `Loss%` column shows the percentage of packet loss at each hop. The `Snt` column counts the number of packets sent. 

The next four columns `Last`, `Avg`, `Best`, and `Wrst` are all measurements of latency in milliseconds. Last is the 
latency of the last packet sent, `Avg` is the average latency of all packets, while `Best` and `Wrst` display the best 
(shortest) and worst (longest) round trip time for a packet to this host. In most cases, the average `Avg` column should 
be the focus. The final column, `StDev`, provides the standard deviation of the latencies to each host. The higher the 
standard deviation, the greater the difference is between measurements of latency.

When analyzing MTR output, you are looking for two things: loss and latency. An example test result of `mtr -P 80 -T -w <ip>` 
is shown below:

The question marks `???` appear when there is no additional route information. In the above example, there isn't much information 
available from hops 9 to 16. When variable loss is reported between hops, it is advised to trust response times from later hops. 

In the above example, there is 20% packet loss from hop 6 to hop 7 and 80% from hop 7 to hop 8. The destination also has 80%
packet loss. This could lead to high latency (10s of seconds) and in this case, it seems to be down to hops 6, 7 and 8. Note
that some packet loss is due to rate limiting. If there's no packet loss on the destination, it means the connectivity is good. 
Notice the latency above averages at 86.4 ms. Hops 8 to 16 seem to have introduced around 100ms delay in this case.

The ability to specifiy a source address and port, makes this tool particularly useful for testing intra-cluster latency.
One can specify a source address and port as well as which protocol to use instead of ICMP, e.g. UDP or TCP.

For example, if one sets `dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address=:7688` on the neo4j server side, it may be useful to test the
network latency which will be added to query response times by executing the MTR trace _from_ the server towards the client, 
e.g. as `sudo mtr -rwn -i 2 -c 5 -P 7688 -T <ip of the client, or, another cluster member>`.

For a sample 3 core causal cluster with `dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address=:7688, dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address=:7689 and 
dbms.connector.bolt.listen_address=:7690`, we can test the intra-cluster latency between instances 1 (source) and 2 (destination) as:
e.g. `sudo mtr -c 5 -T -P 7689 192.168.8.103`:
