Commencing with Neo4j 3.0 and the introduction of stored procedures as well as link:https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures[APOC^] one can utilize the stored procedure link:https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/current/graph-updates/data-creation/[apoc.create.addLabels^] to move a property to a label with Cypher as follows

[source,cypher]
----
// create a node with property studio
create (n:Movies {name: 'A Few Good Men', studio: 'Warner Brothers'})
----

[source,cypher]
----
// move the 'studio' property to a label and remove it as a property
MATCH (n:Movies) 
call apoc.create.addLabels([ id(n) ], [ n.studio ]) yield node 
with node 
remove node.studio
return node
----
