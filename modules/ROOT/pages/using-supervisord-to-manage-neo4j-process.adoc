In general, running the neo4j process directly is the most common way to start and stop the neo4j server. 
However, if you use supervisord to manage processes, this has worked for others.

Things to keep in mind:

`supervisord` can only manage non-daemonized processes, so you will need to use `neo4j console` instead of `neo4j start`.

You need to configure the correct "stopsignal" in the supervisord configuration so as not to cause issues with the cluster on unexpected restart. 

In particular, set:

[source,conf]
----
stopsignal=SIGTERM
----

Here is an example `supervisord` configuration that has worked in production:

[source,conf]
----
[program:neo4j] 
command=/usr/local/neo4j-enterprise/bin/neo4j console 
user=neo4j 
autostart=true 
autorestart=unexpected 
startsecs=30 
startretries=999 
priorities=90 
exitcodes=0,1,2 
stopsignal=SIGTERM 
stopasgroup=true 
killasgroup=true 
redirect_stderr=true 
stdout_logfile=/usr/local/neo4j-enterprise/data/log/neo4j.out 
stdout_logfile_backups=10 
stderr_capture_maxbytes=20MB
