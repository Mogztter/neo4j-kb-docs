*Installing Neo4j Database on Debian or Ubuntu fails with the error:*

----
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 neo4j-enterprise : Depends: cypher-shell (< 1.2.0) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
----

*Why is this happening?*

The apt package manager is not handling multiple versions of a package, in this case Cypher Shell 1.1.12 and 4.0.

*How to circumvent this issue?*

Until we find a solution to this issue we suggest the following workaround:

Add `cypher-shell=1.1.12` to the end of your apt install command, eg:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt install neo4j cypher-shell=1.1.12
----

This way you ensure the lastest supported Cypher Shell version will be installed for the Neo4j Database version 3.x.
