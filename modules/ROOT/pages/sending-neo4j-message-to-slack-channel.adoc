Although not specific to Neo4j and this knowledge base document is provided as a convenience, if your environment has a
https://slack.com/[Slack] implementation, then Slack provides an https://api.slack.com/[API] to allow you to
programmatically send messags to a specific channel.   This can be helpful, for example to send a message on success/failure of 
backup by checking the [https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.5/backup/performing/#backup-performing-exit-codes[exit code of backup.

Using the Slack https://api.slack.com/tutorials/slack-apps-hello-world[`Hello World`] example as a starting template, one will be 
guided through the process of creating a Slack app and resultant WEBHOOK_URL to post messsages to.

For example on backup failure 

[source,shell]
----
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data '{"text":"Backup Failure"}' YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
----

replacing YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL with its actual value, for example the following code on a linux implementations

[source,shell]
----
host=`uname -n`
time=`date`
msg="{   \"text\":  \"Backup failure on $host at $time\"   }"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data "$msg"  https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
----

will result in a message to your Slack channel similar to
