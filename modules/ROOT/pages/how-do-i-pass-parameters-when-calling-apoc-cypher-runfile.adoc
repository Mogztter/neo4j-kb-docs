https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-apoc/[APOC] allows one to have a stored procedure, 
https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#run-cypher-scripts[apoc.cypher.runFile], to then run the contents of 
the file to the Cypher engine.   To allow the reading of the file in the conf/neo4j.conf one needs to define

[source,conf]
----
apoc.import.file.enabled=true
----

and then if one defines a file, for example `import/myRunFile.cyp` and it contains the following content

[source,cypher]
----
create (n:Person {id:123, name:'Emil Eifrem'});
----

the running via Cypher

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.cypher.runFile("myRunFile.cyp",{}) yield row, result;
----

will create the :Person node with id=123 and name='Emil Eifrem'.   

However if you want to provide more flexibility such that you pass in via parameters the values for `id` and `name` this can be
accomplished by changing the contents of the import/myRunFile.cyp such that it is defined as 

[source,cypher]
----
create (n:Person { id: $id_p1, name: $name_p2});
----

and then calling the apoc.cypher.runfile as follows

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.cypher.runFile("myRunFile.cyp",{parameters: {id_p1: 123, name_p2:'Emil Eifrem'}}) yield row, result;
----
