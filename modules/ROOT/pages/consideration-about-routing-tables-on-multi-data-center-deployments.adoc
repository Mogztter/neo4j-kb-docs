Using the official Neo4j drivers means that you can take advantage of the full cluster routing capabilities of the drivers. This means 
your requests will be routed automatically to the appropriate instance:

* If your request is a write: it will be routed to the Leader instance
* If your request is a read: it will be routed to a Follower/Read Replica instance

Community drivers also exist for many languages, but vary greatly in terms of feature sets, maturity, and support. To find out more

Routing drivers with routing context are an available option when using drivers of version 1.3 or above together with a Neo4j Causal 
Cluster of version 3.2 or above. In such a setup, a routing driver can include a preferred routing context via the query part of the 
bolt+routing URI. In the standard Neo4j configuration, routing contexts are defined on server side by means of server policies. Thus 
the driver communicates the routing context to the cluster in the form of a server policy. It then obtains refined routing information 
back from the cluster, based on the server policy.

When deploying a multi-data center cluster we often wish to take advantage of locality to reduce latency and improve performance. We 
therefore highly recommend configuring the server groups in a way they can map to data centers, availability zones, or any other 
significant topological elements from the operator's domain.

However, even after you correctly configure your server groups, you may observe a higher latency in some requests. If you're
experiencing this, probably it's due to the routing table population. When we get the routing table from the Core servers we do so in 
a random way, not obeying server policies. The reason behind this design is because we want to prevent situations where an instance 
repeatedly sends stale routing information.

The drivers pull new routing information in 3 occasions: 

* Driver object creation:

 - `driver driverObj = new driver( "bolt+routing://server:7687?policy=EU" )`

* Failed connections

 - When there's a failed connection, the driver marks the routing table as stale and pulls a new one from a random Core.

* TTL 

 - When the TTL expires. The default value is 300s but you can adjust this by setting `causal_clustering.cluster_routing_ttl` in
 `neo4j.conf`
