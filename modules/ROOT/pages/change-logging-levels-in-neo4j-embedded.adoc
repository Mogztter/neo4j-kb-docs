In order to change the default logging levels in a Neo4j embedded instance, you must edit/define the configuration file, which is XML.
In particular the file is `neo4j-logback.xml`.

The `neo4j-logback.xml` file must be located in the classpath, so that `org.neo4j.kernel.logging.LogbackService` can find and read the configuration.
