This error has only been reported if your environment was previously on a Neo4j 3.5.x release and then later upgraded to 4.0.x, where `x` 
is <=2.

This error is addressed in Neo4j 4.0.3 forward.   
If you have encountered this error the workaround is to utilize https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/4.0/tools/copy/[neo4j-admin copy]
which is an offline activity and will read a database and create a new copy of the database without the errors in the underlying
`data/database/*` files.
