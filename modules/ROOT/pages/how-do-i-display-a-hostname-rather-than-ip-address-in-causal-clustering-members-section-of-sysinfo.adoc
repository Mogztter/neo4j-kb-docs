Via the browser one can enter `:sysinfo` to display data about the Neo4j system. When Neo4j is configured as a 
https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/clustering/causal-clustering/[causal cluster], the bottom-right corner of the 
`:sysinfo' output will display the members in the cluster as depicted below:

Each of the addresses are presented as hyperlinks.

If you want to replace the IP addresses with hostnames, this can be achieved by modifying the config option  `dbms.connectors.default_advertised_address` in the file `$NEO4J_HOME/conf/neo4j.conf`.

For example if you define this setting as follows:

[source,conf]
----
# The address at which this server can be reached by its clients. This may be the server's IP address or DNS name, or
# it may be the address of a reverse proxy which sits in front of the server. This setting may be overridden for
# individual connectors below.
dbms.connectors.default_advertised_address=neo4j-CoreEdge
----

then upon restart of Neo4j, re-running `:sysinfo` in the browser will now yield:
