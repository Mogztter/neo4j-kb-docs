When running a https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/3.5/clauses/merge/[MERGE], which is a combination of MATCH and/or CREATE one may 
encounter an error of `Cannot merge node using null property value for` if the MERGE is performing a MATCH against a null property.
For example, when using the following input file, test.csv

[source,csv]
----
id,name,employee_number
101,Emil Eifrem, Neo001
102,Mary Smith, Neo002
,Joseph Wilson-contractor, Neo003
----

and such that the 3rd value in the CSV has a NULL `id` property, if one runs

[source,cypher]
----
load csv with headers from 'file:///test.csv' as row 
merge (emp:Employee {id: row.id}) set emp.name=row.name, emp.employee_numer=row.employee_number;
----

this will error with

[source,shell]
----
Cannot merge node using null property value for id
----

One can avoid this error by rerunning the cypher statement as

[source,cypher]
----
load csv with headers from 'file:///test.csv' as row  with row where row.id is not null 
merge (emp:Employee {id: row.id}) set emp.name=row.name, emp.employee_numer=row.employee_number;
----
